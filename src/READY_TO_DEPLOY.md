```

The site will automatically rebuild and update in ~2 minutes!

### Test Locally First

Before deploying changes, test locally:

npm run preview    # Preview production build
```

## 🎯 What Happens When You Deploy

1. **GitHub Actions runs automatically** when you push code
2. **Build process:**
   - Installs all dependencies
   - Compiles TypeScript → JavaScript
   - Bundles React components → optimized JS
   - Processes Tailwind CSS → minified CSS
   - Creates production-ready HTML
3. **Deploys to GitHub Pages**
4. **Site is live** at https://FelixSandeersHere.github.io/kynara/

Your React app is automatically converted to optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that works in any browser!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you get 404 errors:
- Verify GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Check that the repository exists at: github.com/FelixSandeersHere/kynara

### If images don't load:
- The base path is already correctly set to `/kynara/`
- Check browser console for specific errors

### If build fails:
- Check the Actions tab for error details
- Make sure all dependencies are listed in package.json
- Verify there are no TypeScript errors locally with `npm run build`
